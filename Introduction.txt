Hi there! I’m an experienced frontend developer with over 8+ years of 
expertise in building high-performance, responsive web applications. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
along with frameworks like React, enables me to create seamless user experiences that prioritize both functionality and aesthetics.

I have a proven track record of collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions, 
and I’m passionate about optimizing performance and ensuring accessibility. My commitment to best practices and continuous learning keeps me at the forefront of industry trends and emerging technologies.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy mentoring junior developers and contributing to open-source projects. 
I’m excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills in a dynamic environment and help create impactful digital experiences.
