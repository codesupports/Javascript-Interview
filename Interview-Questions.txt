Qus: difference between synchronous and asynchronous in javascript?
Ans: Synchronous code moves slowly and only does one task at a time. Asynchronous code executes numerous tasks

=================== Javascript and react js Interview questions==============

PrintName.sayHi.apply(nameObj, [42], [22]);
..............................................................................

3) Explain useEffect, useMemo, useCallback hooks.

useEffect: is used for handling side effects and executing code after rendering or when certain dependencies change.

useMemo: is used to memoize the result of a function or expression to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

useCallback: is used to memoize functions, especially useful for optimizing child components that depend on callback functions.

All three hooks take an array of dependencies. When these dependencies change, useEffect runs its effect function, useMemo recomputes the value, and useCallback recreates the memoized function.
