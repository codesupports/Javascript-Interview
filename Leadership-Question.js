Ques: How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in a frontend project?
Ans: Code Reviews, Linting and Formatting, Modularization, Testing, Documentation, CI/CD

Qus:  What is your approach to optimizing frontend performance?
Ans: 
Lazy Loading: I implement lazy loading for images, components, and resources to reduce the initial load time, loading only what the user needs.
Code Splitting: I use tools like Webpack to split JavaScript into smaller bundles, reducing the size of initial loads and improving the time to interactive (TTI).
Image Optimization: I ensure that images are served in the appropriate format (e.g., WebP for modern browsers) and compressed to reduce their file size.
Minification and Compression: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files are minified and compressed using tools like Terser and Gzip to reduce their size and improve download speeds.
Caching and CDN: I leverage browser caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve static assets, reducing load times for repeat visits.
Performance Monitoring: Tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest are used to identify bottlenecks, and I set performance goals for loading and rendering.

  Qus: How do you handle cross-browser compatibility issues?
  Ans: Cross-browser compatibility is essential for delivering a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices. Here's how I approach it:
  Progressive Enhancement: I ensure that the core functionality of the application works in all browsers, and enhance the experience for modern browsers with additional features (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox).
  CSS Resets and Vendor Prefixes: I use a CSS reset (like Normalize.css) to minimize inconsistencies in browser styles, and ensure that vendor prefixes are used where necessary (e.g., -webkit-, -moz-).
  Polyfills: For older browsers that do not support modern features, I use polyfills like core-js to ensure compatibility with features such as Promises and fetch.
  Cross-Browser Testing: I regularly test the application in various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE) using both real devices and browser testing tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs.
  Feature Detection: I use tools like Modernizr to detect feature support and provide fallbacks or alternative implementations for unsupported features.
